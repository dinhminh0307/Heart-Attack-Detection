# Heart Attack Detection Analysis

A comprehensive data analysis and machine learning project focused on heart attack detection using clinical and demographic data. This repository contains exploratory data analysis, statistical testing, data preprocessing, and machine learning model development.

## üìä Project Overview

This project analyzes heart attack risk factors using a dataset of clinical measurements and patient demographics. The analysis includes statistical hypothesis testing, data visualization, feature engineering, and the development of predictive models to identify individuals at risk of heart attacks.

## üìã Dataset Description

The dataset contains clinical and demographic information for heart attack prediction:

### Features:
- **age**: Patient age in years
- **sex**: Gender (0 = female, 1 = male)
- **Chest pain type**: Type of chest pain (1-4 scale)
- **trestbps**: Resting blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **cholesterol**: Serum cholesterol (mg/dl)
- **fasting blood sugar**: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (0 = false, 1 = true)
- **resting ecg**: Resting electrocardiogram results (0-2 scale)
- **max heart rate**: Maximum heart rate achieved
- **exercise angina**: Exercise-induced angina (0 = no, 1 = yes)
- **oldpeak**: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- **ST slope**: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (1-3 scale)
- **target**: Heart attack risk (1 = low risk, 2 = high risk)
